I am a Software Engineer looking for a company with a mission I can really get behind, working collaboratively on improving peoples lives through innovation. The most enjoyable aspect of coding for me is writing a working piece of code which is efficient, succinct and accessible. I get immense satisfaction from seeing a feature come to life via my code. Having absolutely loved improving my technical skills at Le Wagon, I am now looking to draw on my strong communication and organisational skills gained from my time as a Reinsurance broker and apply them into a Junior Full Stack Developer role. 

<h1 align="center">Skills</h1>
<h2 align="left">Problem Solving</h2>

From solving sudoku's when I was young to solving complicated mathematical problems, I have always loved problem solving. During my time at Le Wagon, I faced many complicated coding challenges from which I felt an immense sense of satisfaction and enjoyment from solving. Post bootcamp, I continue to improve my technical skills by completing challenges on sites such as leetcode. I am also working on a new project using Rails and React.

<h2 align="left">Strong Communication Skills</h2>

I have always prided myself on my strong soft skills. As a scrum half in rugby, being the link between backs and forward, it was vital my communication was clear and concise. I then took this into my Reinsurance career, where relationships and clear communication were of paramount importance during renewals so clientâ€™s and reinsurerâ€™s needs were met. I always tried to broke with professionalism, honesty and integrity whilst also showing the Client in the best light possible. I found that when coding, and particularly during the group projects, communication was equally, if not even more important than in insurance.

<h1 align="center">Experience</h1>
<h2 align="left">Le Wagon London (Graduated December 2022)</h2>

<ul>
<li>9-week intensive course learning key coding concepts such as OOP, TDD and DRY.
<li>Languages learnt include Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and SQL.
<li>Independent learning; would often take spare time to work on tangents that I found interesting and were off the syllabus, such as using Cloudinary for image upload.
  </ul>

<h1 align="center">Projects</h1>

During projects, I learnt how to work in a Scrum environment, using 1 week sprints to optimise productivity and achieve a MVP. In our daily stand ups, we discussed any issues/bugs and used a Kanban board to prioritise the key tasks and create tickets using the core user journey we had designed on Figma. I also learnt how to discuss and merge conflicts on Github when working on a project in groups. B I worked across the whole stack on both apps. Both apps were hosted on Heroku.
